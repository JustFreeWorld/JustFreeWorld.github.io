December 18, 2023

US is actively involved in the indiscriminate killing of Palestinians.
Politicians, senators, members of congress are all silent and/or afraid to talk.
Large protests erupt in the US to express anger over the use of US taxpayer money to support mass killing of civilians in Gaza.

## Defense stock protest

Large US retirement companies such as State Street Corporation, BlackRock, and The Vanguard Group are among the largest shareholders in the defense stocks.
Growing activism among US public to customize their 401K plans including excluding investments in defense stocks.
We'll keep updating this blog as more information being shared online.

# Moral bankruptcy and reverse brain drain in the US
## Summary
As someone working in a top tech position in Fortune 10 company in the US who graduated from one of the top universities in the US, I have been a technocrat believing that science and tech can make the world a better place. However, watching the moral bankruptcy by the US leaders who are funding and supporting the mass killing of children in Gaza is haunting me, it's not about politics anymore. Knowing that my taxes are contributing to this and that I'm spending my prime years, skills, and energy to support such morally bankrupt regime made me to start looking for a career somewhere else. 

## Will the US economy suffer from my absence? 
Absolutely no, but at least I wouldn't feel the massive guilt. At least, I'd have a reasonable answer when my grandchildren ask me what did I do after learning in their history class about the 6,000 kids killed in Gaza by Israel with the US support in 2023.

## But US is democracy?
This is the biggest scam that I learned the hard way. Most US politicians are only loyal to their campaign donors "anything"PAC (Political Action Committee) rather than the poor voter. The disgusting unashamed media double standards is another big story. I have no issues at all with the US public, many of them are victims of media brainwash unfortunately.

## Message to the Free World leaders:
You have once in a lifetime opportunity to attract top "moral" talent who will genuinely build your country into the next moral superpower. 
Easing the rules for attracting talent must be given a priority.

## Message to the free talent in the morally bankrupt countries:
I encourage you to consider seeking opoortunities in free world countries where your talent, taxes won't be supporting an economy that prioritize killing children.
