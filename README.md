# Moral bankruptcy and reverse brain drain in the US

I am working in an very senior tech position in Fortune 10 company in the US after completing my graduate studies in one of the top universities in the US. I am considered as a high earner and have a very successful career per the company's Chief Officers. However, watching the moral bankruptcy by the US leaders who are funding and supporting the mass killing of children in Gaza is haunting me knowing that my taxes are contributing to this.
